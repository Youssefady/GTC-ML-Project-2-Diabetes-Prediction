# GTC-ML-Project-2-Diabetes-Prediction
Workflow:

Data Exploration (EDA) – Understanding the dataset, distributions, and relationships.

Data Preprocessing – Splitting data before scaling to avoid leakage and standardizing features.

Model Building & Hyperparameter Tuning – Training Logistic Regression and SVM with GridSearchCV.

Prediction Engine – Deploying a function that predicts diabetes status for new patients.
